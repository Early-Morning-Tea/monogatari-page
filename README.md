# A Monogatari Page
A website created by two friends who binge-watched the Monogatari series to practice front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository is for our personal learning and future reference.

The page started off as a project from The Odin Project. The website structure is inspired by https://criosyom.github.io/Hakurei_Shrine/.
